#1 The objective is to construct a pipeline that can run inference by reading checkpoints

	*Preprocessing
	  1, whiten the image
	  2, Resize the image
	  3, transpose image channels if necessary (no need for now)
	  4, expand to 4D dimension

	*SSD network
	  1, original VGG
	  2, extra layers (includes pad2d)
	  3, multibox layer 
		$ two head conv, one for location, the other for classification
		$ 3*3 convolution, the output channels: number of anchors * 4 for location, number of anchors * classes for
		  classification
	  	$ two output tensor. (1,H,W,num_anchors,4) for location, (1,H,W,num_anchors,num_classes)
   
	*Postprocessing
	  1, generate anchors by different level of shapes. Because the outputs from SSD model is the relative values.
	  2, combine bboxes from different branches, and get scores and classes by thresholding the predictions
	  3, clip the bboxes in oder to preventing out of bounds
	  4, sorting bboxes according their scores and do non-maxium surpression


	Done

#2 The objective is to construct a training pipeline which can finetuned on ImageNet
